#packcygon

Rudimentary implementation of the 'cygon' two-dimensional rectangular bin-packing algorithm.

#usage

1. Have some selected objects.

2. Use spacebar-menu to search for cygon pack objects (cyg should be enough) ... and press enter.

3. Adjust the fudge parameter in the active operator panel or with f6.


#notes

I made this years ago but it was modal (roll mouse to adjust fudge) and that was silly.
