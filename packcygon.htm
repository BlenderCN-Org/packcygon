<p>Packcygon</p>
<p>Packcygon applies a 2d bin-packing algorithm to selected objects, trying to place them within the smallest possible footprint.</p>
<p>Objects must have dimension along X and Y, thus empties, cameras and lamps are not considered.</p>
<p>An adjustible "fudge factor" fine-tunes the guess for target footprint size.</p>
